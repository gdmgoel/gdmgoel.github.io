            <li><b>Prerequisites</b>: Familiarity with the material on the Ross first-year sets, up to and including topics such as prime and irreducible elements, ideals, and algebraically closed fields.

        <sup id="fn1">1. This course is NOT for first-year students at Ross, and first-year students are generally not encouraged to take this course; if you are a first-year student who <em>really</em> wants to sit in, let me and your counselor know and we can discuss your specific situation.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

        <sup id="fn2">2. If you would like to come to this course but are unsure about whether you have enough background, you probably do. Even if you don't, I believe that you will certainly gain something from coming to the lectures, even if you don't understand them fully.

        <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
  The current (tentative, possibly slightly ambitious) list of topics I plan to talk about is:
                <ol>
                    <li> Affine algebraic curves over an arbitrary field \(k\), coordinate rings, affine changes of coordinates
                    <li> Lots of examples (e.g. synthetic constructions, parametric and polar curves), digression on connections to other fields of math (e.g. number theory, complex analysis)
                    <li> The interplay between algebra and geometry: irreducibility, reducedness, finiteness of curve intersection using Gauss's Lemma, Nullstellensatz for \(\mathbb A^2_k\)
                    <li> Local properties: smoothness, tangent lines/cones, multiplicity of a point, rational functions, local rings, local intersection multiplicity
                    <li> Introduction to the projective plane and projective curves, points at infinity, (de)homogenization, projective changes of coordinates
                    <li> Classification of affine and projective conics over \(k=\mathbb C\)
                    <li> Theorems of Bezout and Max Noether and applications (Pascal's Theorem, Pappus' Theorem, <s>Cayley-Bacharach</s>  Chasles's Theorem)
                    <li> Classification of projective cubic curves and introduction to elliptic curves (e.g. associativity of group law)
                </ol>
                Further topics (if time permits) might include:
                <ol start = 9>
                    <li> Topology of real plane curves (connected components, convexity, nesting, Harnack's Theorem)
                    <li> Inflection points, polars and Hessians
                    <li> Pencils of conics, parameter spaces, solving the quartic equation using algebraic geometry
                    <li> More on elliptic curves (Weierstrass normal form, torsion points)
                    <li> Divisors and the Riemann-Roch Theorem (and applications)
                    <li> More singularity theory: conductors, knots, etc.
                </ol>

        Some other useful references at a level similar to that of this course are:
            <ol>
                <li> <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/en/curves.php">These lecture notes</a> by Andreas Gathmann for a similar course.
                <li> The first two chapters of Miles Reid's textbook <em>Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry</em>, legally available for free <a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/Miles.Reid/MA4A5/UAG.pdf">here</a>.
            </ol>
        The following are more advanced textbooks suited for a full-scale undergraduate course on algebraic geometry:
        <ol start = 3>
            <li> The textbook titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-8176-4443-1"><em>Introduction to Plane Algebraic Curves</em></a> by Ernst Kunz.
            <li> Fulton's textbook titled <em>Algebraic Curves: An Introduction to Algebraic Geometry</em>, legally available for free <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf">here</em></a>.

        </ol>
        For much more encyclopaedic, somewhat outdated, but still fairly accessible treatments, I would recommend:
        <ol start = 6>
            <li>The book by Brieskorn and Knörrer titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-0348-5097-1"><em>Plane Algebraic Curves</em></a>.
            <li>The book by Walker titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9780387903613"><em>Algebraic Curves</em></a>.
